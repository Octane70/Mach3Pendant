ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* README.mdown
* screenshots/
* screenshots/Screenshot_2012-01-14-16-16-42.png
* screenshots/Screenshot_2012-01-14-16-17-18.png
* screenshots/Screenshot_2012-01-14-16-17-44.png
* screenshots/Screenshot_2012-01-14-16-19-56.png
* screenshots/banner.png

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets/
* libs/FlurryAgent.jar => app/libs/FlurryAgent.jar
* libs/bugsense-trace-1-1-2.jar => app/libs/bugsense-trace-1-1-2.jar
* libs/kryonet-1.04-all.jar => app/libs/kryonet-1.04-all.jar
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
